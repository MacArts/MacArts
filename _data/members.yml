    description: Central Arts Council acts like the glue between the four subject councils&colon; Music, Drama, Dance and Visual Arts. We help consolidate the different   events that each council does by confirming dates, handling advertising aspects and backstage components. We also have meetings with the chairs of the subject councils to flesh out upcoming initiatives, brainstorm new events and reflect upon past events. Central Arts Council brings Mackenzie Arts in Bloom, the yearly application forms and the Virtual Awards Ceremony.
