  - name: Much Ado About Zoom Class
    description: >-
      When the students in Ms. Leonard's virtual English class begin studying
      William Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing', art starts to imitate
      (virtual) reality! The result is a gripping tale of romance, drama,
      heartbreak, betrayal, and laughter that only Shakespeare and virtual high
      school can provide. Will Hannah and Caleb's love survive? Will Ben and Bee
      ever make it work? Will Dawn and Val ever figure out what's going on,
      like, ever?


      Your friends at the MacArts Drama Council proudly present the first-ever all-virtual school production, 'Much Ado About Zoom Class'! 


      Will YOU accept the call?

    description: As a result of being unable to hold any in-person event for Arts in
      Bloom, Visual Arts Council adapted and held a virtual paint night! For
      this event, participants are able to join a zoom link where Visual Arts
      Council’s own chairs will lead the event, going through painting
      techniques and using those techniques to replicate a painting. At the end
      of the event, participants are able to hold up their artwork for everyone
      to see or shared on the Visual Arts Council Instagram account.

  - name: The Mural
    description: In 2019, the Visual Arts Council started to create a mural to be
      displayed at MAC. However, Covid-19 broke out and we had to adapt. Instead
      of continuing our project on canvas, we cut out literal puzzle pieces from
      a sheet of wood and distribute them to the volunteers helping to create
      the mural. After a few months and the hard work from our volunteers, we
      were finally able to finish our mural which will be displayed this year in
      June at Mackenzie! Look out for any year-long projects by Visual Arts
      Council coming up!
