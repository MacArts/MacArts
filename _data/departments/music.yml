  Music Council is a group of students that represent the music department of
  Mackenzie. We help organize shows and help coordinate our ensembles and
  other initiatives. This year we ran virtual performances and rehearsals as
  well as mentorship programs for our junior students. We have many ensembles
  you can join. For beginner students we welcome you to the Junior Band and
  Choir and for our more experienced players you are welcome to the Wind
  Ensemble, Jazz Band, Choir and to our Klezmer Band by invitation. Letâ€™s make
  music and come together.
