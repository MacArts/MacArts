  Visual Arts Council strives to promote the visual arts that have been
  created by Mackenzies talented students! Despite having remote schooling for
  most of the year, Visual Arts Council was still able to create events for
  all of MAC to enjoy! This year we had The Monthly Theme Artwork Submissions,
  Valentines Themed Food Week, Paint Night during Arts in Bloom and our year
  long mural project. We would love to hear from you if you have any
  questions, concerns, comments, cat pictures or just to chat!
