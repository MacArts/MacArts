    <p class="council__description">
      Music Council and our students are incredible individuals who Make Music and Come Together. We love to share our passion and dedication for music and performance with the larger community and with the other councils. We are proud to see continued membership in our ensembles and events from all grades and we hope to promote our Music Family as it grows. Mac Music has provided this family to countless students over the years and we aim to honour its traditions and create many more of our own. We gather together on and off the stage and create meaningful relationships with our fellow musicians. Each student will remember their endless rehearsals, their late night shows, the first time they looked into the stage lights, and every time weâ€™ve made it to curtain. 
      Make Music and Come Together.

    <h3 class="council__name">Drama Council</h3>
    <p class="council__description">
      Mackenzie drama council is a small but dedicated group of students who work hard to bring performance to the student body. Our mission is to increase the love and respect for theatre and performance at mac while also providing a safe place for anyone who loves drama to be themselves and have fun. You do not even have to be an actor to join drama council: we welcome anyone with a passion for the arts who wants to have a hand in creating magnificent productions and spreading our shared love of acting. Drama council meetings are lighthearted and fun, filled with theatre jokes and playful banter that makes our team feel like more of a family.

    <h3 class="council__name">Dance Council</h3>
    <p class="council__description">
      Dance council is a group of motivated students with a passion for dance!  We strive to bring a stronger dance presence in the Mackenzie community. Organising events that help engage students to show off their dance skills such as our holiday TikTok dance event has been a highlight! Dance Council is a place where all students can come together and express their shared love for the art and we welcome any and all students! Dance is a way for students to express themselves in ways that words cannot and we are always working on new exciting initiatives such as dance workshops and fun events. Through the strong efforts of our entire council, we are constantly working on finding new and creative ways and events to help foster the dance spirit at Mackenzie!

    <h3 class="council__name">Visual Arts Council</h3>
    <p class="council__description">
      Visual Arts Council strives to promote the amazing arts at Mackenzie as well as inspire students to create art! We believe that everyone has the potential to create art no matter how skilled they are or what medium they use. Learning the process and meaning behind a piece of art is truly interesting and we love to share it throughout MAC. Besides sharing artwork, we also share art history knowledge from well known artists. Visual Arts Council is a relaxing council that anyone can join at any time.
