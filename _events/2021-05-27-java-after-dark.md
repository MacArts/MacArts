Java After Dark is Mackenzie’s collaborative cross-discipline arts showcase. Students perform a variety of acts from lovely solos, beautiful visual art pieces, films, spoken word and poetry. This event is open to all Mackenzie students and we encourage you to audition and perform alongside the best of Mackenzie’s arts scene.
