Arts in Bloom is a one-week celebration of The Arts that happens each year in the springtime! Each day of the week is scheduled with a performance or workshop that focuses on one of the art forms before ending the week off with a show that is all-encompassing. You donâ€™t want to miss the biggest week for MAC Arts!
