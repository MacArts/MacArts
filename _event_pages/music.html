  Music Council is the student body representing the Mackenzie Music Department and its students. We are proud to support our annual shows and concerts including our winter / holiday concert, “Sounds of the Season, our spring concert, “May Music Night”, and various other showcase performances. Our largest event is “Java After Dark” which is our coffee house style event with a variety of performances from all of the arts disciplines. This year, due to Covid restrictions, we are happy to announce that all of our performances will be livestreamed on the WLMAC Arts Department Website and Youtube channel. In addition to our shows we created and operate the Mackenzie Music Mentorship Program where we facilitate new ways for our younger students to learn and for our older students to share their knowledge to let everyone Make Music and Come Together.
