  As a council that strives to promote Mackenzie’s visual arts, we always try to find a way for artists to inspire and urge students to share their artwork to the school! Every month, we have an initiative called “Monthly Artwork Submissions” where we provide a theme for a dedicated month. From there, submitted artwork will be shown on our Instagram page @wlmac.visualartscouncil for all of MAC to see! On top of the Monthly Artwork Submissions, we also have smaller events such as our “Valentines Food” event , “Artist of the Month” and “Arts in Bloom.” However, as a result of Covid, all of our events have taken place online, we hope that in the future, more of our events are able to take place in person!
