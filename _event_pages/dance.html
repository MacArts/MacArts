  Dance council is in charge of running any and all Mackenzie Dance-related events taking place throughout the school year. In a typical year, the council works hard to help put on  events such as Dance Nights, Culturama and a variety of different dance spirited events! Dance council comes together and collaboratively creates new and exciting events each year. Some of the initiatives we run throughout the year include social media campaigns such as dance challenges and  awesome dance workshops both with student run and professional choreographers which are open to the entire student body!
