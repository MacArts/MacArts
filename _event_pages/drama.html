  Drama council is responsible for orchestrating any drama department or performing arts based events that take place at Mackenzie. From small workshops to full fledged productions, no endeavour is too big or too small! In past years, drama council has headed showstopping events such as Cabaret in 2017, The Audition, and Much Ado About Zoom Class, which were all loved school wide. Drama council works hard to cover every part of these endeavours, from backstage to tech and lighting to posters to set and costume design. These events are all a truly collaborative effort and are all part of bringing theatre and performance to mackenzie.
